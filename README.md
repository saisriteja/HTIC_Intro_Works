 <br>
2 points in space 3d radius construct a virtual cylinder, visualize it
2 arbitrary points on the outside
line or vector intersect at any point what is the intersection point
what is the minimum between the point and the sphere using newton approximation distance

<br>

 visuals of cylinder and point or a line intersection if exists  [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/saisriteja/htic_works/blob/main/cylinder%20and%20points%20of%20intersection.ipynb
